    "#### These statistics provide insights into the average wait times based on the number of ID/boarding-pass checkers and personal-check queues. Here's a summary of the trends observed:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### As the number of personal-check queues increases:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### With 1 ID/boarding-pass checker, the average wait time generally fluctuates but tends to hover around 4-5 minutes.\n",
    "#### With 2 ID/boarding-pass checkers, the average wait time remains relatively stable, ranging from about 2.8 to 3.3 minutes.\n",
    "#### With 3 or more ID/boarding-pass checkers, the average wait time tends to decrease and stabilizes around 2.8 to 3.2 minutes.\n",
    "#### As the number of ID/boarding-pass checkers increases:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### With 1 or 2 personal-check queues, the average wait time generally decreases slightly as the number of checkers increases.\n",
    "#### With 3 or more personal-check queues, the average wait time remains relatively stable regardless of the number of checkers.\n",
    "#### Overall, the data suggests that increasing the number of ID/boarding-pass checkers and personal-check queues can help reduce average wait times, with diminishing returns observed beyond a certain point. However, the impact of additional checkers is more pronounced when there are fewer queues, while the impact diminishes when there are more queues available."
